# Express.js REST APIs

This repository contains a collection of simple API examples built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, demonstrating basic concepts like setting up a server, handling routes, and interacting with an SQLite database.

Each project is located in its own subfolder and includes a dedicated `README.md` file with specific instructions for setup, usage, and API endpoints.
